<h1>Lab 3: Multi-threaded programming</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
In this lab, you will implement a model of an online store.  Your
model will support safe parallel updates to a central inventory
database, which maintains stock of all items available for sale
from the online store.  Updates to this inventory database will
come from both suppliers (who add goods to the inventory and
enable or disable deals on items, such as discounts and free
shipping) and customers (who, by purchasing items from the online
store, remove them from the inventory).  In the model,
customers and suppliers will be represented by different threads,
all executing in parallel.
</p>

<p>
Though your store is only a model, the concepts you will learn
and use throughout this lab could be applied similarly in a
real-world setting.  Suppliers and customers would be on
different computers, talking to a central inventory database over
the Internet.  Requests sent over the Internet from suppliers and
customers would be handled by different threads on the central
inventory computer, and any operations on the database would have
to be done with proper synchronization, just as in your model.
</p>

<p><b>Please note the following expectations:</b> 

</p><ul>

<li><i>Comments</i>. As with the last labs, you are asked to comment
every block of code that you write. As a rough guideline, figure that
you need a one-sentence comment every four lines or so (but this is
rough; feel free to comment larger blocks). In these comments, you must
explain the <i>purpose</i> of the code, rather than narrating the
instruction that you gave to the computer. Examples of not-good comments
are, "assign variable X to variable Y", "dereference pointer P", or "the
following code is a for loop that iterates over the foo array." An
example of a better comment would be, "We are closing the following file
descriptors because [insert reason here]". To be clear: in the real
world, it is terrible style to comment code that is obvious or
self-documenting. We are departing from that because, this being a
class, we want to make sure that you understand and can explain your
code.</li>

<li><i>Coding style</i>.
You will have to pay
attention to things like indentation and spacing (which need to be
consistent), variable names (which need to be clear and consistent),
repeated code (which needs to be avoided), spaghetti code (which needs to
not happen), etc. Follow <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~trinabh/classes/w23/styleguide.html">this style guide</a>
(also due to Eddie
Kohler, adapted from <a href="http://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/wiki/2014/Style">here</a>).</li>

<li><i>Concurrency commandments</i>.
You will need to read <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~trinabh/classes/w23/labs/programming-with-threads.pdf">Coding
Standards for Programming with Threads</a>, by Mike Dahlin. <b><i>You are required
to follow these standards for this project</i></b>.
In the real world, unclear multi-threaded code is
particularly dangerous â€“ because it is difficult or impossible to test. Moreover,
if it's not clear, then the
programmer who comes after you cannot debug it, maintain it, or add new
features.
</li>

</ul>

<p>Because it is impossible to determine the correctness of a multithreaded
programming via testing, grading on this project will primarily be based
on reading your code.  If your code is difficult to understand, then you
will lose points (potentially lots of them), even if the program seems
to work. 
</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>We recommend doing this lab inside the development platform that you
set up in the previous labs (the virtual devbox or the CSIL machines).
However, this lab uses standard interfaces and tools, and as a
consequence, you ought to be able to do the lab on OS X or even cygwin
on Windows (though we have not tested this). As always, we will be
grading on the standard lab platforms.</p>

<p>From within the development platform that you have chosen (which, in the
recommended cases, will be the virtual devbox or the CSIL machines),
change to your lab directory, use
Git to commit changes you've made since handing in lab 2 (if any),
obtain the latest version of the course
repository, and create a local branch called <tt>lab3</tt> based on 
<tt>origin/lab3</tt> (which is our lab3 branch). The commands are as follows, but you
may not need all of them (for example, if <code>git status</code> indicates that
there are no changes to commit):
</p><pre>$ <kbd>cd ~/cs170</kbd>
$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution to lab2'</kbd>
Created commit 254dac5: my solution to lab2
 3 files changed, 31 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
$ <kbd>git pull</kbd>
Already up-to-date.
$ <kbd>git checkout -b lab3 origin/lab3</kbd>
Branch lab3 set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/origin/lab3.
Switched to a new branch "lab3"
$ <kbd>cd lab3</kbd> 
</pre>

<h2>A Quick Introduction to C++</h2>

<p>A very helpful way to think of shared state is as shared
<i>objects</i>. We're
therefore going to use C++, C's object-oriented descendant, for this
project. 
</p>

<p>If you haven't used C++ before, don't worry. For the subset of C++ relevant to this project, the
learning curve will be gentle (especially assuming you
already know Java). Furthermore, we will provide template code to
which you will add the details; this should largely insulate you from
having to learn much C++ syntax.
</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~trinabh/classes/w23/ref/c++.pdf">A Quick Introduction to C++</a>, and you should
be good to go. Note that this document was written over a decade ago,
so a few of the comments on the state of standards and tools are a bit
out of date (for example, the document warns against using C++ templates
because debuggers didn't understand them well back then; this warning
is much less applicable today.) Nonetheless, it provides a good, quick
overview of the key ideas to use (and some issues/pitfalls to avoid.)
</p>


<h2>Working with Threads</h2>

<p>
As noted earlier, you will need to read and follow <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~trinabh/classes/w23/labs/programming-with-threads.pdf">Coding
Standards for Programming with Threads</a>, by Mike Dahlin.
If you're shaky on monitors (we covered them in class, but you might
want reinforcement), see <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-monitors.pdf">this
chapter from OSTEP</a>.
</p>

<p>
To simplify your task, we supply a simple thread package (written by
Mike Dahlin)
on top of the standard POSIX thread library (which is known as
pthreads).
The idea is to shield you from irrelevant
detail. This
way, you use the standard package but you also focus on the
project at hand. However, you are not required to use
the wrapper; you may instead use pthreads if you so
choose.  The code for the simple thread package (which we will
refer to hereafter as sthreads) we provide is in
<tt>sthread.cpp</tt> and <tt>sthread.h</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The package provides threads (<tt>sthread_t</tt>s),
mutex locks (<tt>smutex_t</tt>s), and condition
variables (<tt>scond_t</tt>s)
as well as some other utility functions that you may
need.  We suggest that you read over these functions 
to see how they are used.  It may be helpful to write a couple of
example programs using sthreads before starting this project.
For more information, see the man pages for the pthreads
library functions used in the <tt>sthread.cpp</tt> code.
</p>

<!--
<p>
In a pinch, you can use <tt>pthread_t</tt>s,
<tt>pthread_mutex_t</tt>s and so on interchangeably with <tt>sthread_t</tt>s,
<tt>smutex_t</tt>s and so on.  You may have to do this happen if you end up
wanting to use a certain pthreads function which does not have a
corresponding sthreads wrapper in <tt>sthread.c</tt>.
</p>
-->

<p>
You should keep the following in mind as you code these labs:
</p><ul>
<li>
If you find that the problem is underspecified, please make
reasonable assumptions and document them in the documentation file.
</li>

<li>
You are required to adhere to the multi-threaded coding standards/rules
discussed in class and above.  Code that fails to conform to these rules
is incorrect and will receive little credit when this lab is graded.
</li>

<li>
Code will be evaluated based on its correctness, clarity,
and elegance. Strive for simplicity. Think before you code.
</li>

<!--
<li>
Write test cases for your code.  Just hacking at multi-threaded
code and hoping it works is a sure way to produce code that
doesn't work, or worse, code that seems to work but has subtle
bugs that crop up in only a small fraction of executions.
</li>
-->

<li>
One of the most common
mistakes we see on projects year after year is using <tt>sthread_sleep</tt> when
you should be using <tt>scond_wait</tt>. The standards document above discusses this issue in more
detail. This year, we don't want anyone to make this mistake, so be
warned: seeing an <tt>sthread_sleep</tt> in your code in the wrong place is an easy way for a TA to
conclude that you don't know how to write multithreaded programs, and the
TAs will be instructed to deduct a large number of points from any project
that uses <tt>sleep</tt> when it should <tt>wait</tt> on a condition variable. If you
find yourself writing <tt>sleep</tt>, treat that as a red flag that you might be
making a mistake. If you don't know when to use one and when to use
the other, come to office hours, but don't start writing code!
</li>

<li>
Before writing any code, think of
different types of simple generic data structures
(e.g., bounded buffer, readers/writers, ...). These particular data structures
may (or may not) be directly useful for this project, but this flavor of
data structure will be extremely useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Part A: Task Queue and Coarse-Grained Store Synchronization</h2>

<p>
For our model, we will simulate a fixed number of customers
and suppliers.  For each customer and each supplier, there will
be a unique thread representing that customer or supplier.  We
will often refer to these threads throughout this document as
<i>worker threads</i>.  These worker threads will get jobs to
work on from a <i>task queue</i>, which you will implement.
There will be one queue for all customer threads
and one queue for all supplier threads.  This
task queue must allow for multiple worker threads to simultaneously
attempt to add or remove jobs while still maintaining the
integrity of the queue's internal data structures by using locks
(i.e., your task queue must be <i>thread-safe</i>).
</p>

<p>
It is a common pattern in multi-threaded programming to have a
single (or small number of) task queue(s) for a large number of
threads.  A thread-safe task queue makes the job of allocating
work to threads (and having threads allocate work to other
threads, should the case arise) easy to do and (relatively) easy
to reason about.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Remember, you <b>must</b> follow the restrictive coding standards
specified.  There are specific reasons for these rules: we
believe that if you follow these rules, you are very likely to
learn to write good multi-threaded code. Conversely, if you
violate these rules, we fear that you may not learn this material
as well. Code that fails to conform to these rules is incorrect
and will receive little credit when this lab is
graded.
</p>
-->

<div class="required">
<span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
Look through the queue interface in <tt>TaskQueue.h</tt> and the
documentation for its methods in <tt>TaskQueue.cpp</tt>.  Fill out
the rest of the members in <tt>class TaskQueue</tt> in
<tt>TaskQueue.h</tt> to finish the definition of
your task queue class, then implement the rest of the queue
methods in <tt>TaskQueue.cpp</tt>.  You are welcome to use any
standard C++ container to help build the functionality of your
queue (such as a <tt>std::queue</tt> or <tt>std::deque</tt>), or
you can create your own data structures (like a linked list) and
add any needed helper structures to do the same.
<p></p>
<p>
A task in the task queue is represented by a <tt>struct Task</tt>
(also found in <tt>TaskQueue.h</tt>), which consists of a pointer
to a function and an argument to be passed to that function.
When a worker thread removes a task from the task queue, it
should call the function given in the <tt>struct Task</tt> with
the argument given in the <tt>Task</tt>.
</p>
Run <kbd>make</kbd> to make sure your queue code compiles.  For
now, there's no executable to run.
</div>

<p>A task queue is little good to worker threads if there is no work
available to be put on it.  We have provided some code to
generate work requests to be put on your task queues in
<tt>RequestGenerator.h</tt> and <tt>RequestGenerator.cpp</tt>.
Become familiar with this code.  Specifically, there are two
subclasses of the main <tt>class RequestGenerator</tt> that you
should know the purpose of: <tt>class
CustomerRequestGenerator</tt> and <tt>class
SupplierRequestGenerator</tt>.  The former
<tt>CustomerRequestGenerator</tt>, as its name would suggest,
generates requests for customer threads to perform (such as
buying items).  The latter <tt>SupplierRequestGenerator</tt>
generates requests for supplier threads to perform (such as
adding or removing items from inventory, or putting items on
sale).  You will use these generator classes to implement
task generator threads, which will produce work for customer and
supplier threads.
</p>

<p>
Before you start implementing any thread functions, however, you
should actually have some threads running.  In the main source
file for our simulator, <tt>estoresim.cpp</tt>, is a function
called <tt>startSimulation</tt>.  This function kicks off all
threads in the simulator (generators, customers, and suppliers)
and then, after starting all threads, waits for them to
finish.  When all threads have finished working, the simulation
is complete.
</p>

<div class="required">
<span class="header">Exercise 2.</span>
Read the documentation for, and then implement, the
<tt>startSimulation</tt> function in <tt>estoresim.cpp</tt>.  Use
<tt>sthread_create</tt> to create threads.  The worker thread
functions <tt>supplierGenerator</tt>, <tt>supplier</tt>,
<tt>customerGenerator</tt> and <tt>customer</tt> all reside in
<tt>estoresim.cpp</tt>.
Use the provided <tt>class Simulation</tt> to keep track of task
queues and the number of customers and suppliers.  When you have
finished writing your code, run <kbd>make run-sim</kbd> to run
the simulator.  You may want to have the threads produce some
output to make sure that you are starting them correctly.
<p></p>
<p>
Don't worry about the meaning of the <tt>fineMode</tt> variable
in <tt>Simulation</tt> for now, just make sure it is set to the
value passed in the parameter <tt>useFineMode</tt>.
</p>
You may also find it useful in this exercise, and in others
throughout this lab, to
call <tt>printf</tt> in some choice places (where worker threads
start, for instance).  The code we provide you doesn't print
anything to the terminal, and so when you run the simulator with
<kbd>make run-sim</kbd>, you won't see any output unless you put
the <tt>printf</tt>s in yourself.
</div>

<p>
At the moment, all of the threads you have created start
and then immediately stop, as none of their associated functions
are implemented (they just return when called).  However, since
you have actual threads running, you can proceed to implement the
generator, customer, and supplier thread functions.  If you put
<tt>printf</tt>s in these functions as suggested, you should see
all the threads print to the terminal.
</p>

<div class="required">
<span class="header">Exercise 3.</span>
Implement the <tt>customer</tt>, <tt>supplier</tt>,
<tt>supplierGenerator</tt>, and <tt>customerGenerator</tt>
functions in <tt>estoresim.cpp</tt>.  Read the code referred to
above (e.g. <tt>RequestGenerator.cpp</tt>) and the comments for
these functions to get an idea of what they should be doing.  The
generator functions should look similar to each other, as should
the supplier and customer functions to each other.  Produce some
output from these threads to make sure they're running and that
jobs are being pushed between them properly.
<p></p>
<p>
For the <tt>supplierGenerator</tt> and <tt>customerGenerator</tt>
functions, you will also have to implement the
<tt>enqueueStops</tt> method in <tt>RequestGenerator.cpp</tt>.
</p>
Run <kbd>make run-sim</kbd> to run the simulator.  You should see
the output of your worker threads.
You can stop the simulator by pressing
<kbd>Control-C</kbd>.
</div>

<p>
Now you have many customers and suppliers working on jobs
generated by the generator threads.  But there is no inventory
for items in the store, nor are any of the work functions
produced by the request generators implemented.  So, for the
moment, our simulator spawns many workers in parallel to do very
little.  For the workers to have anything to work on, there
should be an inventory of items to purchase from and add to.  To
this end, we
have provided the skeleton of this inventory for you as <tt>class
EStore</tt>, in the files <tt>EStore.h</tt> and
<tt>EStore.cpp</tt>.
</p>

<div class="required">
<span class="header">Exercise 4.</span>
Design and implement the <tt>EStore</tt> class, filling in all
the method skeletons we provide and adding any new methods you
may find necessary.  Read through all
the provided comments in the files related to the <tt>EStore</tt>
class (but don't worry about the <tt>buyManyItems</tt> method for
now).  The <tt>EStore</tt> will have to keep track of many
<tt>Item</tt>s and ensure that all modifications to
<tt>Item</tt>s in the <tt>EStore</tt> are synchronized.
<p></p>
<p>
You should implement the <tt>EStore</tt> as a monitor; that is,
there should be a single lock on the entire store, which is
acquired upon entering any of the store's methods and released
upon exit.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, the <tt>buyItem</tt> method in <tt>EStore</tt>
should <i>wait</i> for an item to become available or on
discount if necessary.  So, if a customer comes in looking to buy
an item outside of the given budget, the customer should wait until the
item is being sold at a sufficiently high discount and then buy,
instead of just immediately returning.
</p>
Run <kbd>make run-sim</kbd> to make sure your code compiles and
doesn't have any segfault-inducing bugs in the constructor for
<tt>class EStore</tt>.
For the moment, no threads are actually interacting with the
<tt>EStore</tt>, so if you put any <tt>printf</tt>s in its
methods, you won't see them output anything just yet.
</div>

<p>
There is only one piece remaining to make the simulator work now:
the handlers for the jobs created by the request generators
and pushed to the worker threads.  These jobs consist of adding
and removing items from the <tt>EStore</tt> inventory or setting
discounts on items (for suppliers) and of purchasing items (for
customers).  We've provided skeletons for these handlers in
<tt>RequestHandlers.cpp</tt>.  Before you implement these
handlers, you may find it helpful to read through all the
different kinds of requests that exist in <tt>Request.h</tt>.
</p>

<div class="required">
<span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
Go through and implement each handler in
<tt>RequestHandlers.cpp</tt> one-by-one.  Print a message at
the beginning of each handler which contains the name of the
handler and the fields of the request struct passed to it (you
don't need to print the value of the <tt>store</tt> pointer).
This will produce a trace of the work done by your threads as
they process jobs.
<p></p>
<p>
Your handler functions should largely make use of the methods you
implemented previously in <tt>EStore</tt>.
</p>
<p>
After implementing all the handlers (including <tt>stop_handler</tt>),
your simulator may not terminate on
its own.  This will happen in the case where a customer is
blocked on buying an item, but the item never gets discounted
enough for the customer to buy, which will happen sometimes and
should be expected.
In this case, you will still
need to kill the simulator with <kbd>Control-C</kbd>.
</p>
Run <kbd>make run-sim</kbd> after you
implement each handler and make sure that requests are being
dispatched to your new handlers.
</div>

<p>
Here's some example output from the staff solution to part A of the lab to
give you an idea of what running your simulator should look like.
You don't have to worry about matching our output format exactly.
</p><pre>Handling AddItemReq: item_id - 77, quantity - 94, price - $6370.15, discount - 0.00
Handling BuyItemReq: item_id - 83, budget - $14308.86
Handling BuyItemReq: item_id - 35, budget - $33853.86

...
Handling StopHandlerReq: Quitting.
Handling StopHandlerReq: Quitting.

</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You should now have a working store simulator.  Run
<kbd>make run-sim</kbd> a few times and watch the output of your
workers as they process jobs.  If you notice anything suspicious
in the output, go back and check to make sure you did your
synchronization correctly and that you are following the
multi-threaded coding guidelines.
</p>

<h2>Part B: Fine-Grained Store Synchronization</h2>

<p>
In part A, you implemented a store simulator using <i>coarse-grained</i>
synchronization: there was one lock on the entire <tt>EStore</tt>
that kept concurrent accesses from stepping on each other, which
effectively serialized execution of the program (as no two threads could modify
the inventory in <tt>EStore</tt> at the same time).
However, you might have noticed that you don't necessarily need
to lock the entire inventory if two threads are trying to modify
two <i>different</i> items in the inventory.  <!--
IR: The performance mention here is superfluous, since we're not
making the simulator "faster".

While having one
lock on the entire inventory is a good way to get your feet wet
with multi-threaded programming, when implementing real systems, one must give
consideration to performance <i>and</i> correctness. -->  Thus, in
part B, we will explore an approach that exposes more parallelism, by
using <i>fine-grained</i> locking. Instead of using one large lock
on the entire <tt>EStore</tt>, you will use locks over smaller units of
code.
In this way, multiple
threads that aren't touching the same data can operate on the
inventory concurrently.
<!--, relieving the serialization of execution
suffered by the previous coarse-grained locking implementation.-->
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind throughout the next exercises that you should be
able to run the simulator using your old coarse-grained locking approach
by running <kbd>make
run-sim</kbd> and using your yet-to-be-implemented fine-grained
locking approach
by running <kbd>make run-sim-fine</kbd>.
<!--
<b>MW: This ``fast'' thing probably won't fly. Fine grained locking does not
always mean ``faster''. In fact, this point was covered implicitly in
lecture, and we'll keep returning to it. So ... probably a good idea to
name it something else (unless there's concrete evidence in the output
that the simulator runs faster, but I don't see that).</b>-->
The latter command, as might
be expected, runs the simulator in "fine-grained mode" (this
is related to the mysterious <tt>fineMode</tt> variable you saw
before, which is set to <tt>false</tt> with <kbd>make
run-sim</kbd>, but set to <tt>true</tt> with <kbd>make
run-sim-fine</kbd>).  You may
want to abstract some of your locking with methods whose function
varies depending on the value of <tt>fineMode</tt>.  To
reiterate, <i>your simulator must use your coarse-grained locking
approach
from part A when we run <kbd>make run-sim</kbd> and use your new
fine-grained locking approach to be done in part B when we run <kbd>make
run-sim-fine</kbd></i>!
</p>

<!-- MW: why are we calling this run-sim-fast? the code may not in fact
run faster. it depends on the available hardware, the I/O patterns, etc. -->
<!-- IR: Explanation here of fine-grained locking?  Buh.  Suggest
lock-per-item?  Buh! -->

<div class="required">
<span class="header">Exercise 6.</span>
Change your <tt>EStore</tt> implementation to allow multiple
threads to access different items at the same time.  If two
threads try to access the same item at the same time, then only
one should be allowed to modify the item at a time.
<p></p>
<p>
Don't worry about modifying the implementation of
<tt>buyItem</tt>.  In fine-grained mode, <tt>buyItem</tt> is not called.
You will implement the fine-grained mode version of <tt>buyItem</tt>,
called <tt>buyManyItems</tt>, in the next exercise.
</p>
Run <kbd>make run-sim-fine</kbd> to make sure your code still
runs.  Since you are now running in fine-grained mode,
<tt>BuyItem</tt> requests are not being generated; instead,
<tt>BuyManyItems</tt> requests are generated.  This function is
still unimplemented, so only suppliers will be making any
modifications to the state of the <tt>EStore</tt> at the moment.
</div>

<p>
To flex the new fine-grained locking features of the
simulator, you must implement the handler and <tt>EStore</tt>
functionality for the <tt>BuyManyItems</tt> request.  This
request requires that many items be looked at (with
synchronization!) and, if the right conditions hold, modified
(i.e. purchased).
</p>

<div class="required">
<span class="header">Exercise 7.</span>
Implement the <tt>EStore</tt> method <tt>buyManyItems</tt> and
its corresponding handler in <tt>RequestHandlers.cpp</tt>.  Make
sure that, as with previous request handlers, you print out the
name of the request and the fields of the request struct passed
to the handler at the beginning of the <tt>buyManyItems</tt> handler.
<p></p>
Run <kbd>make run-sim-fine</kbd>.  You should now see
<tt>buyManyItems</tt> requests being handled by threads.  You should also
make sure that your old code still functions correctly with
<kbd>make run-sim</kbd>.

Here's some sample output from the staff solution to part B.  As
before, your output doesn't have to look exactly like ours, but
this should give you an idea of what we'd like to see when we run
your simulator.
